 implement actual image filtering
 
 arrow keyboard navigation
 
 when zoomed in on image:
  n/N counter to know at which image you are

DONE:
 test my cool image viewer approach
 -> implemted zooming, works really well
 
 add proper directory input
 -> works very good, at least for dev use

 added actual async disk-to-ram loading of full size images using a thread pool
 -> really cool, and worked without any problems

 implemented fullscreen toggle
 implemented window placement saving and restore when restarting app

 prototype of texture streamer:
  -> always downsize image to exactly the size it is viewed at and evict textures as soon as they disappear or are viewed at different sizes
   -> needed to cancel jobs (and ignore job results that are no longer needed (ie. should have been canceled but were already in processing)) to not create giant workloads when zooming
   -> images only start being visible after zooming has stopped and there is a very big workload constantly -> not a good system
 
 implemented dragging around
