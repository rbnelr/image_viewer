design ideas:
 implement dragging around

visual:
 fix mipmaps not being generated
 
 if filtering is still ugly, look at filtering techniques

functionality


DONE:
 test my cool image viewer approach
 -> implemted zooming, works really well
 
 add proper directory input
 -> works very good, at least for dev use

 added actual async disk-to-ram loading of full size images using a thread pool
 -> really cool, and worked without any problems

 implemented fullscreen toggle
 implemented window placement saving and restore when restarting app
